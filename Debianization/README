How to build the package inra-eugene
------------------------------------

1. Copy a eugene-<no>.tar.gz distribution of eugene and extract it
2. Move eugene-<no> in inra-eugene-<no> directory
   (be sure to have the last Makefile.am and .in that 
    does not provide execute permision when no necessary,
    this avoid a lintian warning)
4. Go in the inra-eugene-<no> directory and execute:
    dh_make  --copyright artistic -e cros@ossau.toulouse.inra.fr -s
5. Update the inra-eugene-<no>/debian directory 
    If minor modifications were done, remove the created debian directory
    and copy Debianization/debian directory at the same place.
    Note that updating the files changelog and copyrigth (if <no> has changed) 
    may be sufficient.
6. Empty environnement variables: CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, CPPFLAGS
7. debuild -rfakeroot --preserve-env

Note that the following packages need to be installed:
* dh-make (for dh_make)
* devscript (for debuild)
* lintian 
* fakeroot
* gnupg (generation of a key with gpg --gen-key)

It is possible to test the installation with:
  dpkg -i inra-eugene_<no>-1_i386.deb
  eugene doc/Sequences/SYNO_ARATH.fasta
  dpkg -r inra-eugene

What remains
------------
1. Check of the Build-Depends defined in the debian/control file
2. Improve of the man documentation

3. Remove of the warning "Compatibility levels before 3 are deprecated." 
    appeared with the 3.3 packaging.
