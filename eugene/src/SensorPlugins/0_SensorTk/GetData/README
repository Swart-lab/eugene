To build WAM matrices:

A multifasta file containing a consensus for the considered signal is required.

consensus = upstream context (uc) + signal + downstream context(dc)

Example for a virtual start file, with ATG and a short context (3+2):
>Start01
ATTATGCT
>Start02
TTTATGCA
>Start3
CACATGTT
...

Some parameters are also required (explained by egn_WAMbuilder -h)
1 Name of the multifasta file
2 Signal pattern
3 The upstream context length
4 The downstream context length
5 The order of the markovian models
6 Base name for the output

One model (binary file) is build per position of the consensus.
For the WAM sensors (SignalSensor for instance), two sets of 
model are required, one for the true positive, and one for the
true negative (at each signal occurence ATG, GT or AG the log 
likelihood is computed).
