 Documentation of the Plotter sensor

\subsubsection{\texttt{Sensor.Plotter}}

\paragraph{Description}

The Plotter sensor allows to add to the graphical representation the GC\%,
the GC3\% and the two quotients A/T+A and T/T+A.

The sensor is activated by the value 1 for the parameter
\texttt{Sensor.Plotter.use} in the parameter file.

Here is an example of Plotter parameters definition :
\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\small]
Plotter.GC          1         #
Plotter.GC3         1         # 0 -> no plot  -  1 -> plot
Plotter.A|T/A+T     1         #
Sensor.Plotter.use  1      # Use GFF sensor
Sensor.Plotter      1         # Sensor priority
\end{Verbatim}

\paragraph{Input files format}

No input files  needed.

\paragraph{Integration of information}

This sensor does not affect prediction.

\paragraph{Post analyse}

No post analyse.

\paragraph{Graph}

The GC\% is plotted as a thin turquoise line on the intergenic track.
The GC3\% is plotted as a thin turquoise line on each exon tracks.
The T/T+A quotient is plotted as a thin orange line on the forward intron
track.
The A/T+A quotient is plotted as a thin orange line on the reverse intron
track.
