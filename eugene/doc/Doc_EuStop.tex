\subsubsection{\texttt{Sensor.EuStop}}

\paragraph{Description}

This simple plugin predicts translation stops. It is able to deal with
noisy sequences and will eg. predict a possible stop on \texttt{TGN}.

The sensor is activated by setting the value 1 for the parameter
\texttt{Sensor.EuStop.use} in the parameter file.

The penalty payed for using a Stop is defined by the
\texttt{EuStop.stopP*} parameter.

Here is an example of EuStop parameters definition.
\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\small]
EuStop.stopP*           4.155   # Stop penalty
Sensor.EuStop.use       1    # Use EuStop sensor
Sensor.EuStop           1       # Sensor priority
\end{Verbatim}

\paragraph{Input files format}

No input files  needed.

\paragraph{Integration of information}

In the case of non degenerated sequences, all predictions using a Stop
to end a terminal exon are given an extra \texttt{EuStop.stopP*}
penalty. All predictions going through an in-phase Stop in an exonic
state receive an infinite penalty.

\paragraph{Post analyse}

No post analyse.

\paragraph{Graph}

Every predicted Stop is ploted as a small vertical red bar in the
corresponding phase on the exonics tracks.
