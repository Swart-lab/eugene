Version 4.3

* Improve performance of splicing variant prediction
* Allow to predict only variant from a reference annotation with the -k option
* If AltEst plugin is activate, create two files: one for the initial prediction and one for the variant prediction. (File with the suffix ".variants")
* New parameter 'AltEst.IncompatibilityExonBorderMatchThreshold'. Only AltEst with an exon showing 
...his is the margin used to select the AtEst for which an alternative prediction would be launched.
  An EST is considered a potential variant if one of its exon show a difference with a length upper or equals to that value with a reference gene.

Version 4.2b

*  The plugin 'SignalWAM' allows to predict spliced|start signals with weight-array matrix
*  Improve the way to integrate ESTs: 1) for the same number of gaps, prefer the Ests with 
   the smallest covered region, 2) reduce the number of ejected Ests

Version 4.0a

*  EuGÃ¨ne is able to predict genes for prokaryotic organisms. (more information in doc/EuGeneDoc.pdf generating after compilation)

Version 3.6 

*  Can now predict non protein coding RNA

Version 3.5

* Integrates complete GFF3 based input/output

Version 3.2

* Change the functioning of the software (see the ChangeLog file for more detail)
 
Version 3.1

* New plugin, procedures, parameters, argument
* debug and improvement of the Est and Repeat sensors 
* update in documentation

Version 3.0

* Complete autoconfiscation of the software

Version 2.0

* Use distributions of exon (init, term, intr, sngl), intron, utr and intergenic
